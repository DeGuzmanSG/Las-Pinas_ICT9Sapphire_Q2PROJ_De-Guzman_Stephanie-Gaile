<h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Origins</h2>
<br>

	<p>We started as a small, family-owned business with a dream---to give our fellow Filipinos an easier time to make food for their families and friends. So we started as a small shop that made Filipino cuisine with their recipes if costumers ever wanted to expand their skills and try to make their own. It wasn't easy, of course, we were a small business in a small neighborhood. Despite this, we kept trying to sell and sell, and eventually we amassed enough money to open a store in VeryReal Mall nearby, and most importantly our online shop where we did something similar, selling food with their recipes. </p>
